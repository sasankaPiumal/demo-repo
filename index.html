<h1><b><strong>Git Hub practicing.</strong></b></h1>

<p>
    In the first seven chapters in this book, the focus is on data analysis and not programming. For those
    seven chapters, I do not assume a detailed familiarity with topics such as software design, algorithms, data
    structures, and such. I do not expect you to have any experience with the R programming language either.
    I do, however, expect that you have had some experience with programming, mathematical modeling, and
    statistics.
